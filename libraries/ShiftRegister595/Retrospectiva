Retrospectiva

What went well? *
Tagspire - was the great and big project! 
We got experience team work. Also experience of collaboration with Austin office.
About myself, I've known many new and important things about good mobile development. 
Internal company processes has been improved for during a tagspire project. 
Tagsipre is the first my big project and I was glad to take part here. And Thanks all team! your help with different questions was very useful. I appreciate it.

What didnâ€™t go so well? *
We didn't have ready API in time and Alex worked on it to help quantomic team. But now API is very good) 
Sometimes project looked like part of sine mathematical function because of team changes.
We occasionally had a scope changes.

What we can do better in next project? *
I think we should improve our internal dev processes and go ahead with learning english language to be able  communicate with Austin Office without any language blockers.
