Men cook as a hobby, women cook because they have to.

In my view, relationship should be traditional where man makes money and he is chief of family. About women, firstly women should care about home comfort and raising of children, be good house-proud woman, careful mother, worthy wife, passionate lover for her husband. On other hand, man should create appropriate condition for his family. I think, man must be able to do everything, but he should do only that needs in daily life. So man might cook but this activity should be as a hobby, e.g, as a help his woman or romantic dinner. Woman has to cook because she is woman,  also she has to be beatiful, well-groomed and  well-dressed. Women always want men have to be men. Also men want women must be women.

Sure, there should be love and mutual respect in relationship, but it is not reason that woman can say "I don't have to cook or I don't want to stay near cooker for all my life!" It's unacceptable for me (I remember it from film called terminal =) ). Actually, cooking is quite interesting thing and I think cooking should be with love and soul)
